# Process - Developing a Career Learning Resource for Novel Technology like Blockchain

## Purpose

This section documents a process used to develop career learning resources for novel technologies. Using Blockchain as an example, this guide describes the steps taken to develop the Blockchain Career Blueprint, a guide that gives practitioners the skills they need to integrate Blockchain into their careers. The purpose of this document is to provide a high-level process that a practitioner can use as a template for developing similar resources for other technologies like Artificial Intelligence, GANS, and more.

## High-Level Activities

The following describes several high-level steps that can be added to complete this guide. These steps don't necessarily need to be taken in order. Doing them in parallel and iteratively revisiting them will ensure that lessons learned from each activity will complement the others.

- Analysis of Academic Literature
- Analysis of Job Opportunities
- Analysis of Informal Learning Resources
- Discussions with Practitioners
- Iterative Development
- Maintenance of Learning Resource

## Analysis of Academic Literature
New technologies often appear first in the literature, which means reading articles that describe them in detail is a core step to understanding how to apply them to a career. In the creation of a blockchain career blueprint, the following high-level steps are recommended.

1.	Search for articles that describe the technology at a high level and read those to develop an understanding of the various components of the value proposition of the technology. Literature reviews or analyses of the role the technology plays across the industry are useful for this. The purpose of this step is to identify a topic with the technology that can be explored in further detail. If the author of the guide has previous knowledge of a field, they can use that knowledge to supplement the learning from this resource. In the case of the Blockchain Career Blueprint, the author was aware of the value proposition provided by Blockchain-enabled smart contracts. The author then read a literature review on smart contracts, which provided useful high-level descriptions and further reading topics.
2.	Using the high-level understanding developed from the high-level literature review, conduct a second-level review to search for prominent sub-topics identified in the first round. These topics can include common issues, popular trends, or future research. The goal of this step is to further explore the technology and identify future areas where practitioners can apply their skills in this field over the coming years. In the case of the Blockchain Career Blueprint, the author explored smart contract security and the use of Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), two prominent topics identified in the previous step. Insights from this literature were then included in the rest of the guide.

## Analysis of Job Opportunities

Many practitioners are interested in developing the skills that will make them most marketable if they wish to work in a job using this technology. While some technologies will be further commercialized than others, it may be worth analyzing the job market for various keywords and using a topic modeling analysis to highlight core ideas. The author of the guide can then share that analysis to give users an idea of the types of jobs that exist, the responsibilities of those roles, and the required skills to get that job.
The job analysis in the Blockchain Career Blueprint used the following process.

1.	Identify keywords to describe the skills and qualities relevant to the technology of the job. For example, this guide used terms like blockchain, smart contract, and cryptocurrency. These will be used to help identify suitable positions.
2.	Search jobs sites like LinkedIn Jobs using the identified keywords for available positions. For each position, save the title, the job responsibilities, and the required skills for the job. If one knows prominent companies in this space, search the websites of these companies for available positions.
3.	Create two CSV files as a blank corpus. In one file, save the responsibilities recorded from all the jobs. In the other file, save the required skills for all the jobs.
4.	Perform pre-processing on each file. This could include removing unnecessary words, removing capitalization and extra symbols, and changing spellings on terms that have multiple descriptions (e.g js and javascript, Go and Golang).
5.	Perform a topic modeling analysis on both sets of inputs as per the instructions provided in TIMG5201.
The result of this research is high-level insights into the responsibilities of these jobs and the skills required to get them.

As an additional optional step, some other learning resources (articles, videos) might provide an overview of the category of jobs that exist in this field. For example, Lucas (2020) describes 3 categories of positions in the blockchain field: business, technical, and architecture roles. Sharing a description of the types of available positions can be an additional useful step in this analysis. This additional lens can be applied to the identified skills and responsibilities so users can know which they want to focus on.


## Discussions with Practitioners

A core part of finding content for the guide and validating it is discussing it with practitioners in the field. Creators of the guide are encouraged to reach out to professionals who work with the technology to get their insights. It’s not necessarily easy to find practitioners to talk to, but a few approaches would be to connect with professors on the TIM program who are knowledgeable in this topic or to search for people to talk to on LinkedIn. While many professionals won’t respond to requests to talk, a small number of discussions can have a big impact on the report because they can help clarify the content of the document in a way that is relevant to professionals. This is also an opportunity for the authors of the guide to develop their networking skills.

## Analysis of Informal Learning Resources

There will likely be many informal learning resources for technologies that may be of use to practitioners willing to learn about this space. These include articles, courses, videos, and learning platforms. Many of these resources are free. This is useful because they can be accessed easily, but the disadvantage is that it’s hard to validate the quality of the resource. 

The following are ways to find useful informal learning resources:
- Ask for recommendations from the professionals that were interviewed.
- Find the ecosystems where discussion on this field occurs and see what is recommended in their blogs or FAQs.
- Find prominent people in the space and search for what they recommend across various tweets or articles.
- Follow up on resources that appear more frequently than others.
- Use vetted learning resources like Udemy.

## Iterative Development

The various activities in this project are complementary. For example, learning about a topic from an academic article can lead a user to find several useful informal resources. Interviewing a professional can help refine some concepts and definitions, or lead to a list of jobs to apply to.  Creators of this guide are encouraged to take on all these steps in parallel and to revisit the outputs from each step to ensure that the insights are properly integrated into the guide. Getting inputs from users of the guide is also critical. Authors can create google forms or surveys to get feedback from students in the program on their guide.  For example, this survey was used to help get feedback in the generation of the blockchain career blueprint: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LKhjZVSq4MqEfi7wAIXdlFR7wkhdey1pFbdolaOHk_c/edit

## Maintenance of Learning Resource

Once the learning resource has been created, it will need to be maintained. The rate at which the guide will become outdated depends on the technology, so the maintainer of the guide should be a participant in the ecosystem who has an incentive to keep it up to date. For example, someone maintaining the blockchain career blueprint can be someone who is actively learning about and working in the blockchain space and is using the guide as a public repository for their current knowledge on the topic. If the document is proactively maintained it will be less hassle than if it were to be changed all at once. 

One of the more useful parts of this guide is the job analysis. It may be useful to conduct that activity every 6 months or year to see how much it has changed in that time. If it has not changed much, the next iteration can take place later, but it will be up to the judgment of the maintainer. 
While it is good to have an official maintainer, anyone should be able to make contributions to this document since it is hosted in a public repository. The more people who have access to it, the more who will be able to contribute to it and ensure it is up to date. The more qualified people who have access to this document, the better it will be able to fulfill its role.
