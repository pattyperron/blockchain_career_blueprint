As of early 2022, most established positions are for software developers. However, the novelty of this technology provides incredible opportunities for practioners in the Architect template who wish to establish themselves as researchers or entrepereneurs.

Practionners in either group should be ready to get technical. A high-level understanding of the cryptography and the concepts that enable blockchain are essential to understanding proper use cases for blockhain. It takes alot of effort and set up, and many applications can be simply done with a centralized database.

Not being a programmer should not stop a practioners from participating in this space. If one can understand the value propositions of this technology and develop a convincing use case, one can instead work like a product manager, creating requirements and specificaitons for the project and hiring a developer to do the building.
