### About This Resource

This guide was developed for students in the TIM Program at Carleton University to help provide them with a concise learning resource that allows them to figure out what they can do to start a career working with Blockchain. It covers the skills they need to learn, how to learn them, and where to start participating. There are many excellent resources to help someone get started with this technology. Rather than reiterate what is described in these resources, this guide will serve as a map to help its users find resources that will be most helpful to them.

Although this guide provides useful information for practitioners of all backgrounds, it currently does have a slight bias towards more techincal roles because an analysis of available positions in the Blockchain space shows that technical positions are most in demand at the moment. However, this technology is still very early in it's widespread adoption and we may expect to see a surge in non-technical jobs working with Blockchain in the future. Practioners from all backgrounds are encouraged to learn more about this technology if they are interested.

### How to Use This Resource
