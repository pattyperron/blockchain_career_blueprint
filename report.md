# What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a novel technology defined as a “ a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding)” and “ anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network” (What is Blockchain Technology?, 2022).

### Blockchain Explained in under 100 words

> “You (a "node") have a file of transactions on your computer (a "ledger"). Two government accountants (let's call them "miners") have the same file on theirs (so it’s "distributed"). As you make a transaction, your computer sends an e-mail to each accountant to inform them.
> 
> Each accountant rushes to be the first to check whether you can afford it (and be paid their salary "Bitcoins"). The first to check and validate hits “REPLY ALL”, attaching their logic for verifying the transaction ("proof of work"). 
> 
> If the other accountant agrees, everyone updates their file… This concept is enabled by "Blockchain" technology.”

## What can Blockchain do?
- Serves as a trusted authority powered by a technology rather than a third-party intermediary.
- Provides "immediate, shared, and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network members." (What is Blockchain Technology?, 2022).
- Stores "all details of a transaction end to end, giving greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.” (What is Blockchain Technology?, 2022).

### Features
- *Immutable*: Designed to prevent tampering
- *Distributed*: Strengthened by running across many nodes across the world.
- *Smart contracts*: Supports user-created programs that determine what is to be written to the ledger.

### Example applications of Blockchain Technology
- Digital currencies (Rodeck and Curry, 2022)
- Tracking ownership of unique digital assets like tickets or real estate (Kejriwal and Mahajan, 2017; Takyar, 2022)
- A tracking system for supply chain managemens (Queiroz et al., 2021)
- A database to store evidence of human rights violations (Spence, 2018)

## Fundamental Concepts
The following terminiology is common across the blockchain ecosystem and are important to understand as a starting point. 
A high-level understanding should be sufficient to get started, but each term has attached resources that can be consulted if the user believes a deeper understanding is needed.

### Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
Distirbuted Ledger Technlogy is an umbrella term for "technological infrastructure and protocols that allows simultaneous access, validation, and record updating in an immutable manner across a network that's spread across multiple entities or locations." Though often used interchangeably, Blockchain is just one common implementaiton of DLT.

### Bitcoin
Bitcoin is the first real-world application of blockchain technology, implemented in the form of a currency. It was introduced by a pseudonomous founder, Saitoshi Nakamoto, in a 2008 white paper that introduced blockchain technology to the world. While Blockchain is not Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is an example of a blockchain application.

### Block
A block is base unit for a piece of data stored on the blockchain.

### Consensus
Consensus is a mechanism by which various nodes in the network agree upon the next block in the network. The first mechanism for this is proof of work, which means a node in the network needs to solve a cryptographic puzzle in order to submit a new block in the network. This expenditure of work detracts malicious nodes from participating in the network and incentives. While this is a reliable method, it can be energy consuming, which leads to new blockchain technologies switching to alternate concensus mechanisms. One popular approach is proof of stake: TODO.

## Cryptocurrency Concepts
Currency is the first and most popular application of blockchain technology because the nature of the technlogy makes it very good as a currency. While not all blockchain applicaitons need to represent it's currency, a practioners wishing to understand how blockchain technology implemented as a cryptocurreny interfaces with 21st century finance.
### Cryptocurrency
A digital form of currency implemented on a specific instance of a blockchain. In this implementation, the owners and ammounts of currency are store in the various blocks of the blockchain. For example, there are various forms versions of Bitcoin(BTC, BSV) cryptocurrency based on the same fundamental technology (Blockchain)

### ERC20 token
A programming standard for cryptocurrencies based on the Ethereum blockchain technology.

### Wallet
A wallet stores an address that can receive cryptocurrency. There are various types of wallets such as software wallets (e.g. Metamask) or hardware wallets An important distinction is that a wallet does not store cryptocurrency in itself, but it stores the private keys that allow access and transfering of that cryptocurrency stored on the blockchain.

## Advanced Concepts
### Oracles
In blockchain, oracles are "third-party services that provide smart contracts with external information. They serve as bridges between blockchains and the outside world"

### Side Chain

A sidechain is a separate blockchain which runs in parallel to Ethereum Mainnet and operates independently. These two chains work together often to help with scale. TODO

### Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO)
A distributed autonomous organization is a new form of an organization or entity where "the
management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention" It is effectively a self-governing entity that interact with various other components according to a predefined set of rules. These rules can also be changed by members of the organizations by voting.

### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
- A digital asset stored on the blockchain that represents ownership of a specific item such as art, music, ticketing, memberships, or property rights. This property can represent ownership of both digital or real-world items.

- Can interact with smart contracts to integrate fine-grained logic when interacting with it, e.g. Sending a portion of every resale of the NFT back to the creator.
- Can represent scarcity in digital from, which is novel considering most digital assets can often be copied without limitation.

# Blockchain Careers
Since this technology is new, many


Blockchain is a technology just as the internet is. While there are many jobs that work directly on providing and maintaing web infrastructure, there are far more career that use the internet as a tool

[a relative link](README.md)

Based on advice provided by X, the work in the role can be put into one of two templates.

- **Architect**
	- Focus on figuring out ===what=== blockchain is used for
	- 
	- Potential Roles: Business Analyst, Product Manager, Entrepreneur, 

- **Developer**
	- Focus on the ===how=== blockhain systems work.

There is overlap in the skills and work done by each of these tempaltes, and this is a feature because members in each group will have to cooperate

The following questions can serve as a quide A practionner wishing to work with Blokchain can approach from one of two perspectives:

-*"What can I do contribute to assist with the ongoing integration of blockchain?"*

-*"How can I integrate blockchain technology into my field?"*


TODO: diagram

As of early 2022, most established positions are for software developers. However, the novelty of this technology provides incredible opportunities for practioners in the Architect template who wish to establish themselves as researchers or entrepereneurs.

Practionners in either group should be ready to get technical. A high-level understanding of the cryptography and the concepts that enable blockchain are essential to understanding proper use cases for blockhain. It takes alot of effort and set up, and many applications can be simply done with a centralized database.

Not being a programmer should not stop a practioners from participating in this space. If one can understand the value propositions of this technology and develop a convincing use case, one can instead work like a product manager, creating requirements and specificaitons for the project and hiring a developer to do the building.
