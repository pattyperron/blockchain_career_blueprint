## Software Development Skills

For a list of recommended tools and programming languages to learn, refer to the [**Blockchain Careers**](blockchain_careers.md) section.  Most of the tools listed in that section are open source and therefore free to use. There are many online resources and youtube videos to get started.

The following are excellent places to learn to program:

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

**Recommended to:** Practitioners wishing to learn the programming skills they'll need for a technical blockchain role.


## Getting Involved

Getting involved means developing the skills to work with blockchain by working with projects that will be useful in the Blockchain Space. Once practitoners have followed up on the recommended learning resources and have a basic understanding of how to work with the technology, they can start to participate. They should not expect to know all there is to know before starting to participate, but that they will be learning through their participation. One of the best ways to participate is to find a blockchain application or project that will keep them interested and use it as a learning vehicle to learn more about the technology and to interact with others in the ecosystem. 

There are two major ecosystems that were identifed as places for students to participate: The Hyperledger project and Ethereum. Below are activites that can be done to better participate in each of these communities.
