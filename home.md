It covers the skills they need to learn, how to learn them, and where to start participating.

There are many excellent resources to help someone get started with this technology. Rather than reiterate what is described in these resources, this guide will serve as a map to help its users find resources that will be most helpful to them.

### How to Use this Resource?
