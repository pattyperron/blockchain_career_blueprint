### Artifact 1: Blockchain Career Blueprint v1
- High level descriptions of 9 blockchain concepts with links to additional readings on each topic.

Question 1: What is your “Make a difference” project about and how Artifact 1 contributes to achieving the project’s objectives. 

My make a difference projects is about helping practitioner of varying backgrounds learn about career opportunities in the blokchain space to empower them to discover their minimum viable path they'll need to follow to discover and learn the skills they need and how they can start participating.

Artifact 1 contributes to achieving this project's objectives by diving deep into the knowledge surrounding the blockchain space and providing high-level summaries fit for individuals whor are new to the technology. It also uses advanced tools like topic modeling to provide a high-level overview of available positions in this space today so practioners are given real data.

Question 2: What value does your project create and frame.

Provides translational value from:
		- Recent literature in Blockchain
		- A snapshot of the existing job market.
		- Insights identified from informal interviews with practitioners in the blockchain field.

Makes it easier for talented individuals to participate in the space by equiping them with the skills they need and guiding them to projects


Question 3: What mechanisms the project will use to create value. 


Mechanism 1: "Introduce offer that meets customers desires and needs better than currently available offers" (Zott, 2003)

This guide acknowledges how easy it is for beginners to get lost in details of a new and complex topic when it would be easier to focus on the bigger picture. Rather than reiterate excellent content distributed across various free resources across the internet, this guide will help students navigate this content by introducing them to the core topics they'll need to know and providing them with a map to places to learn more about these concepts. By combining these resourcse with a data-driven analysis of existing job responsiblites (and their required skills) in the blockchain space, users of the guide will see a clear correlation between the skills they can learn and the opportunites they will provide.

Mechanism 2: "Co-create – engage with consumers in designing the offers" (De Oliveira & Cortimiglia, 2017)

This is a guide designed for TIM students looking for career support about Blokchain and was built by one. However, this is just the starting point. The contents of the guide are to be improved by working with other students in the program. A survey was created to seek help from other students in the class. Will also be reaching out to Blockchain professionals in my network and ask them for advice to help improve my project.


Mechanism 3:"" Operate more than one business model simultaneously – where one 
business model supports the others" Biloshapka & Osiyevskyy, 2018, p. 168
