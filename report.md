## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a novel technology defined as a “ a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding)” and “ anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network” (What is Blockchain Technology?, 2022).

### Blockchain Explained in under 100 words
  “You (a "node") have a file of transactions on your computer (a "ledger"). Two government accountants (let's call them "miners") have the same file on theirs (so it’s "distributed"). As you make a transaction, your computer sends an e-mail to each accountant to inform them.

Each accountant rushes to be the first to check whether you can afford it (and be paid their salary "Bitcoins"). The first to check and validate hits “REPLY ALL”, attaching their logic for verifying the transaction ("proof of work"). If the other accountant agrees, everyone updates their file…

This concept is enabled by "Blockchain" technology.” (Blockchain explained... in under 100 words, 2022)

## What can Blockchain do?
- Serves as a trusted authority powered by a technology rather than a third-party intermediary.
- Provides "immediate, shared, and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network members." (What is Blockchain Technology?, 2022).
- Stores "all details of a transaction end to end, giving greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.” (What is Blockchain Technology?, 2022).

### Features:
- *Immutable*: Designed to prevent tampering
- *Distributed*: Strengthened by running across many nodes across the world.
- *Smart contracts*: Supports user-created programs that determine what is to be written to the ledger.

### Example applications of Blockchain Technology:
- Digital currencies (Rodeck and Curry, 2022)
- Tracking ownership of unique digital assets like tickets or real estate (Kejriwal and Mahajan, 2017; Takyar, 2022)
- A tracking system for supply chain managemens (Queiroz et al., 2021)
- A database to store evidence of human rights violations (Spence, 2018)
