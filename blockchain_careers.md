# Blockchain Careers

Blockchain, like the internet, is just a new form of technology. While many jobs todary work directly on providing and maintaining web infrastructure, there are far more careers today that use the internet as a tool to do meaningful work in other industries. Therefore, practitioners should not only be aware of not curren career opportunities but also think about how they could create opportunities in other fields as the adoption of the technology increases.

### Why pursue a career working with blockchain?
- Help develop applications that can conduct widespread societal change using revolutionary technology.
- Work in a rapidly evolving space that allows for continuous learning.
- Solve challenging problems with overlapping implications in the fields of finance, computer science, ethics, law, and public policy.
- In demand and often higher paying than other jobs in the field of technology ([Lucas, 2020](https://academic.oup.com/itnow/article-abstract/62/4/20/6047516?redirectedFrom=fulltext))
- Many remote and/or cross-border opportunities

### Why NOT pursue a career working with blockchain?
- Most jobs are in startups, which provide less career security.
- Blockchain often operates in an undefined regulatory space for many fields; Incoming regulation can cause disruption.
- Many existing roles are demanding and have a high turnover.
- Mistakes in a blockchain system are immutable and can cost lives and livelihoods.

# Career Roles

According to ["How to start a career in Blockchain"](https://academic.oup.com/itnow/article-abstract/62/4/20/6047516?redirectedFrom=fulltext), an article from IBM's Blockchain Enablement Lead, there are three categories of roles in this field. These categories are not meant to be mutually exclusive but to provide a framework to understand the types of activities that different positions are focused on. 

### Business Roles: *Focus on what blockchain is used for*

The first step to taking advantage of Blockchain technology is to identify a valid use case. Business roles typically focus on identifying valid value propositions built upon blockchain, and can therefore come from a diverse variety of industry backgrounds. There are many opportunities available to individuals "with deep industry knowledge, who understand end-to-end business processes and have an eye for identifying inefficiencies" ([Lucas, 2020](https://academic.oup.com/itnow/article-abstract/62/4/20/6047516?redirectedFrom=fulltext)). 

Potential careers in this space include *Business Analyst*, *Entrepreneur*, and *Researcher*.

### Technical Roles: *Focus on how to build a blockchain system*

The people in technical roles are those that build, test, and maintain the blockchain system after release. Most available positions in present organizations are in this category. A blockchain application is often built upon a typical web application, meaning that many technical roles are available for practioners with web development experience. In addition to building these decentralized web applications, technical roles are also responsible for programming smart contracts in languages.

Potential careers in this space include *Distributed Application(DApp) Developer*, *Smart Contract Auditor*, and *DevOps Engineer*.

### Architecture Roles: *Focus on integrating the technical and non-technical components of the blockchain system*

Architecture roles are a collection of roles sitting in between technical and buiness that "allow a blockchain solution to provide utility for an organisation" ([Lucas, 2020](https://academic.oup.com/itnow/article-abstract/62/4/20/6047516?redirectedFrom=fulltext)). Practitioners in this space must balance an understanding of intricate implementation details along with big-picture implications of how the product is designed. 

Potential careers in this space include *System Architect* and *Product Manager*.

## What role is right for you?

Users of this guide are encouraged to assess their backgrounds and ambitions to figure out which sort of role appeals to them. Practioners in each of the categories above should be ready to get technical, but a high-level understanding of the building blocks of blockchain technology is preferable to specializing in the details too soon, especially considering how quickly the technology can change.

 > "A common mistake made by new starters is to dive into the weeds... It is easy to quickly get disheartened by a dizzying number of concepts and terminologies. Unless you’re looking to advance blockchain technology itself, you generally don’t need to understand the data structures that underpin a blockchain, or how consensus works between nodes on the network. Instead, think of blockchain as a shared database that can be read from or written to; the system will handle how that data is distributed." ([Lucas, 2020](https://academic.oup.com/itnow/article-abstract/62/4/20/6047516?redirectedFrom=fulltext)). 

Practitioners without programming experience should not be dissuaded from participating in this space. If one can understand the value propositions of this technology and develop a convincing use case, one can instead think like a product manager by creating requirements and specifications for the project then hiring a developer to do the building.
